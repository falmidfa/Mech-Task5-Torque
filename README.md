# Mech-Task5-Torque
This project focuses on calculating the **required torque** for each joint in a robotic arm consisting of three segments with lengths of **4 cm**, **10 cm**, and **15 cm**, designed to lift a **1 kg** payload.  
The torque for each joint was calculated using the physics formula:

\[
T = F \times r
\]
