# Mech-Task5-Torque


To calculate the **required torque** for each joint in a robotic arm consisting of three segments with lengths of **4 cm**, **10 cm**, and **15 cm**, designed to lift a **1 kg** payload.  
The torque for each joint was calculated using the physics formula:
## T= F*r
where **F** is the force which is F=mg and **r** is the distance from the rotation axis to the payload.

- T1= 9.81 * (0.15+0.1+0.04)= 2.83 Nm
### Servo: DS3240
- T2= 9.81 * (0.1+0.04)= 1.37 Nm
- T3= 9.81 * 0.04= 0.39 Nm
